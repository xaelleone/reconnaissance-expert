Don't worry about the images; get a feel for the joystick. Try to keep the cursor as close to the center of the circle as possible.
Nice job! Remember that you always want to keep the cursor as close as possible to the center of the circle.
In the bottom right corner there is a recommendation. Red means the automated detector thinks there is an enemy.
Green means that the automated detector thinks the images are all clear.
Excellent! So long as the detector is always correct, you can focus all your attention on the cursor.
Whoops! Turns out that sometimes there is a false alarm, and the automation mistakenly detects an enemy.
Sometimes, it misses the enemy altogether. Take a break; the game is about to begin.
